        "I immediately tried to solve it by hand (everyone wants to be in the other 5%, right?) but failed miserably. Then I wrote a little program that used brute force method for finding a solution. Of course it failed, too. So finally I gave up and searched the internet for the solution, and found it in [this Quora post by Alon Amit](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-find-the-positive-integer-solutions-to-frac-x-y+z-+-frac-y-z+x-+-frac-z-x+y-4) with an excellent and very detailed explanation that is worth reading. Looking at the magnitude of the numbers I immediately understood why the brute force method was doomed to fail.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unfortunately the solution presented in the Quora post is quite complicated and involves advanced math concepts, like elliptic curves and group theory. For example one of the first steps is to find the Weierstrass normal form of the elliptic curve obtained from the puzzle. The solution is then determined by finding a generator of the rational points on the normal form and iterating over the rational points using group addition (described as the 'chords and tangents rule') and finally transformed back to the space of the original elliptic curve. Sounds scary, right? Is it really only 95% of people who cannot solve this or rather is it 99.999995% as Alon Amit estimates in his post? And above all the most important question for me was: _can we do it simpler_?"

An advanced topic in the above solution is finding the Weierstrass normal form. Do we really need this or is it possible to do every action on the original elliptic curve? It turned out that we can completely skip working with the Weierstrass normal form. We can also rephrase the group addition of elliptic curves ('chords and tangents rule') to something less scary looking ('curve and line intersections').<br>\n",
